4) [8.0 points]  Write a program that finds the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 2 numbers. LCM of two integers Int1 and Int2 is the lowest positive integer that is perfectly divisible by both Int1 and Int2. Take 2 numbers as input from the user, and output the LCM of those integers along with the integers. Submit: LCMCalculator.java as an attachment.

Example output statements: 
LCM of  3 , 6 is 6
LCM of 15, 9 is 45
hint: research modulus operator ('%'), shown in Fig 2.12  and the increment operator (Chapter 4 sec 12) '++'. It is not required to use the operators % and/or ++, there are other possible ways of designing the logic.

5) [8.0 points] "Making a Difference" pg. 69 Java Book #2.33. Submit: BMICalculator.java as an attachment.
